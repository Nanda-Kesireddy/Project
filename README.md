Aim of the project is to design the “2D Snake Game”. The Nokia inspired Snake game was implemented on 8051 platform.
A dedicated delay settings key provides one touch access to the delay settings mode where the speed of the Snake can be adjusted.

This game is designed by using Python Programming Langauage. It is a Simple Single Player game.  
In this game player can experience the real graphical interface because we designed the game in GUI(Graphical User Interface) . 
In this we have used four keys left, right, up and down for to move the snake to eat the food. Modules used in this are “turtle, time, random”.
